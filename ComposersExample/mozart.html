                    <p>
                        Born in Salzburg, the son of a composer, Mozart was a musical 
                        prodigy. From a very early age, his father exhibited him in Paris, 
                        Munich, London, and Vienna. From his travels with his father, Mozart was
                        exposed to a wide variety of musical styles. From a very early age, 
                        Mozart showed a mastery of the operatic style. At the age of 12, he 
                        composed the singspiel, "Bastien and Bastienne," and a year later, the 
                        opera buffe, "La Finta Semplice."</p>
                        
                        <p>
                        In 1775, Mozart held an unrewarding position in the Salzburg court. Mozart
                        traveled widely with his mother, searching for a more prestigious position,
                        but none materialized. While in Munich in 1781, he composed the opera,
                        "Idomeneo." He later resigned from his post in Salzburg, taking up 
                        permanent residence in Vienna in the hopes of becoming a court composer.
                        There he married Constanze Weber.</p>
                        
                        <p>
                        Mozart met with moderate success in Vienna. It was there that he composed
                        the singspiel, "Die Entfï¿½hrung aus dem Serail," and the popular "Marriage
                        of Figaro." The success of "Figaro" resulted in a commission for "Don
                        Giovanni," composed in 1787. Also in that year, Mozart received an
                        appointment to the Vienna court. The prestigious appointment did not solve
                        Mozart's chronic financial problems. His prospects did not improve either,
                        when the unsympathetic Leopold II ascended to the throne.</p>
                        
                        <p>
                        With his health deteriorating, Mozart composed the opera, "La Clemenza 
                        di Tito" for the new emperor's coronation.</p> 
                        
                        <p>
                        Mozart died in Vienna in 1791 at the age of 35.</p>
