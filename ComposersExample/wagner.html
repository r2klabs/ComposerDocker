              <h1>Richard Wagner (1813 - 1883)</h1>

                <div class="col-9">
                    <p>Richard Wagner was born in Venice on May 22, 1813. As a youth, he
                        studied music in Leipzig. His first opera, "Die Feen" was written at the
                        age of 20, in 1833. This was followed in 1836 with the unsuccessful
                        "Das Liebesverbot". That same year, Wagner married the actress Minna
                        Planer. Wagner and his family lived for a few years in K&ouml;nigsberg, and
                        then later, in Riga. While in Paris from 1839 to 1842, he composed the
                        grand opera, "Rienzi," and the tragedy, "Der Fliegende Holl&auml;nder."</p>
                        
                        <p>The success of "Rienzi" led to Wagner's appointment as music director in
                        Dresden. More successes followed with "Tannh&auml;user" in 1845 and "Lohengrin"
                        in 1850. However, at the same time, Wagner became involved with political
                        radicals. He was forced to Switzerland after his participation in the 
                        1849 Dresden uprisings.</p>
                        
                        <p>In exile, Wagner began work on his four opera cycle, "Der Ring des 
                        Nibelungen," which occupied much of his life. Taking time off from his 
                        work on the "Ring", Wagner composed the romantic tragedy, "Tristan und
                        Isolde." The opera, "Die Meistersinger" followed a few years later. This
                        opera is notorious for the anti-Semitic expressions of the protagonist.</p>
                        
                        <p>In 1860, he was allowed to return to Germany. A triumphant performance of 
                        "Tannh&auml;user" in Paris confirmed Wagner's stature as international artist of 
                        great renown.</p>
